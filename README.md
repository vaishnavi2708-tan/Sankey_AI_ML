Academic RAG Study Assistant – Computer Networks

Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered study assistant for the Computer Networks course using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

The assistant answers academic questions by retrieving relevant information from real course materials (lecture notes and PDFs) and generating responses using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM).

The focus of this project is experimentation, analysis, and understanding of the RAG pipeline, rather than building a production application.

Objectives
- Process real, messy academic PDFs
- Implement a baseline RAG system
- Experiment with different chunking and prompting strategies
- Compare results and analyze trade-offs
- Handle real-world data challenges
- Reflect on theory vs practice

Course Chosen
