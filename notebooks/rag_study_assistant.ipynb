      "  A computer network is an interconnected collection of autonomous computers that are able to exchange information. It allows computers to communicate with each other using cable media or wireless media for data transfer in the form of packets, as described in the context provided. The best-known example of a computer network is the Internet.\n",

      "QUESTION: What is the difference between a LAN and a WAN?\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      "  A Local Area Network (LAN) is typically used within a single building or a small geographical area to connect devices such as personal computers, workstations, and servers. On the other hand, a Wide Area Network (WAN) spans larger geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs or networks across cities, countries, or even globally. The main difference lies in their scale and the distances they cover. A LAN is usually owned and controlled by a single organization or individual, while a WAN may be operated by service providers like Internet Service Providers (ISPs). To connect different LANs over a WAN, packets are encapsulated and transmitted through a Multi-Protocol Router.\n"
